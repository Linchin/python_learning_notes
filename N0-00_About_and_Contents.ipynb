    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the personal website for taking notes with regards to the techniques, tricks and philosophies while learning coding with python. When knowledge reaches a certain scale, it becomes way easier to write down the points systematically than to memorized them in head. Such organized writing also helps a deeper and more intuitive understanding of the language. \n",
    "\n",
    "I use this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D3LWB0g2847P_vPTuksYeryQrOLYFSoAsKO52zqKSDk/edit?usp=sharing) as a quick side note for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "* Track down and accumulate the pieces of knowledges encountered during learning python\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn to think in perspective and from a bigger time scale\n",
    "\n",
    "* Accumulate knowledges for Linux also\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn to be mindful of what I'm learning and adjust according to the situation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Learn version control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidelines\n",
